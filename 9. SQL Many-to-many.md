### Many-to-many

Let's imagine we want to add actors to our example.

- What do we think about the relation?
- Can one movie have many actors?
- Can one actor have be in many movies?
- Do we want to be able to easily ask which movies has specific actors, and what movies a specific actor is in?

Yes - so it's a many-to-many relationship.

Let's start by creating a Schema for a `actors` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE actors
(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    fullname VARCHAR,
    bio VARCHAR
);

INSERT INTO actors
  (fullname, bio)
VALUES
 ('Harrison Ford', 'my name is harrison'),
 ('Jim Carey', 'my name is jim'),
 ('Sandra Bullock', 'my name is sandra');
```

A movie could have many actors, so could we add a actors field to the movies table? Should we drop the movies table and re-create it with a `actors array` column?

The better way would be to introduce a table that would let us match up actors and movies. This is called a junction table. This way we need just 1 actor and 1 movie in each of their respective tables but the smaller junction table can provide all the information about the many-to-many relationships.

```sql
-- ADD movieActors table
CREATE TABLE movieActors (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    movieid INT REFERENCES movies (id),
    actorid INT REFERENCES actors (actorId)
);

INSERT INTO movieActors (movieid, actorid) VALUES 
(3, 3),
(3, 1),
(2, 1);
```

This table lets have multiple entries and match up a single northcoder entry with a single skill entry.
If i need to update a skill, I can update one place.
If I need to update a student, I can update one place.

BUT the data from the `SELECT` query isnt very easy to interpret on its own. Time for some more `JOINS`!

How can we do this now that it is a junction table?

```sql
SELECT title, movieActors.id, fullname FROM movieActors
JOIN movies ON movieActors.movieid = movies.id
JOIN actors ON movieActors.actorid = actors.actorId;
```

Again we can `select` what we need and use `where` to select on a certain requirement.

```sql
 SELECT title, movieActors.id, fullname FROM movieActors
JOIN movies ON movieActors.movieid = movies.id
JOIN actors ON movieActors.actorid = actors.actorId
WHERE movies.title = 'Blade Runner';

```

## Summary

We need to be aware and think of the relationships of our data. By having seperate tables and using the ids to reference other parts of the data, we normalise it. Normalised means basically that we keep one source of truth. One place that contains all the required information that we may need to update/change and others.

There is a lot more to SQL than just this and it can even be a specialism for some so don't feel like you need to know it all but its still an important part of the process that we need to, at a very minimum, be able to understand and design to a reasonable level (i.e. Facebook won't be hiring you to handle their data).

## TOP TIPS:

1. Don't download the "recommended" Microsoft VS Code extension
2. Uppercase for SQL keywords is optional, but stick to this convention. Everything else lowercase. Leads to much more readable code.
3. RUN YOUR CODE AS FREQUENTLY AS POSSIBLE! SQL error messages are notoriously imprecise. It is much easier to debug 3 lines of code than 30.
