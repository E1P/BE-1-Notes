## MVC

- Now all of that was alot to take so to break it down theres a general format of structuring your api and this is the MVC format

M- model

V- view

C - controller

Model is fundamental behavior and shape of our data

View provides the interface of the application

Controller processes requests and makes calls to models and views to perform appropriate actions

the brains of the app
mediator between the client and the data
So if we have a look at our code identifying the patterns in our cat.txt file and formatting any incoming post requests to fit it is the model part

our controller is doing alot of logic and parsing information, reading files and appending files calling other helper functions to help us format things and ultimately deals with the response
and our view is what we got which is dependent on tht m and c

REST
We're building a RESTFUL api: representational state transfer this doesn't mean much but essentially is an architectural way of designing apps

correct use of HTTP CRUD method
urls clearly representing resourcers in our server
use of paramters
stateless: data isnt held on server but accessed by it
